## What is flick?
Flick is a swipe to match movie selection service. The goal was to produce a web-app that will help me and my partner with our friday night movie selections.
The platform was originally designed to integrate with the Guidebox Movie API so that fresh streaming movies would populate the database but the key could not be acquired.
